# **Timetables**
A web-based schedule builder for creating, modifying, updating and deleting your everyday activities.

## Synopsis
Keeping track of your everyday activites becomes hefty especially having to memorize current and upcoming activities. Organization becomes an attractive
choice for managing many activities.

Timetables was created to help with managing activites on all levels. Although it offers the most basic functionality for schedule management, it is sufficient
enough for anyone to use within their means.

## Getting Started
To get started, log into your Odin account and navigate to the `public_html` directory. If such directory does not exist, make one using this command: `mkdir public_html`. Navigate
into the directory.<br>

Once inside the `public_html` folder, download the latest release using this command:<br>

`git clone "https://github.com/hectorm22/Timetables.git" Timetables`. This will create a directory containing the release. Do not navigate into the `Timetables` directory yet.<br>

The application needs read and write permissions for error logging and database querying purposes. To change its permissions, execute these commands in order:<br>
1. `chmod o+rw ..\public_html`<br>
2. `chmod -R o+rw Timetables`<br>

Then, navigate into the `Timetables` directory.

The application has now been setup and ready to be used. In a web browser, visit your CSUB Odin account URL:<br>

`cs.csub.edu/~<username>/Timetables`<br>

Replace `<username>` with your Odin username and hit enter.<br><br>
